I too sing America

I am the darker brother
They send 😔e to eat in😅the kitchen
When company comes
But I laugh
And eat well
And grow strong

Tomorrow
Ill be at the table
When company comes🍔Nobodyll dare
Say to me
Eat in the kitchen
Then

Besides
Theyll se🚀 😔ow beautiful I am
And be ashamed

I too am America
